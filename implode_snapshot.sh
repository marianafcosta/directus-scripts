# DESCRIPTION
#
# This script will take the files created by the explosion script and glue them back together into a single snapshot file.
# The snapshots folder is expected to have the following structure:
#
#  /target_folder
#    /collections
#      - collections_suggestions.yml
#      - ...
#    /fields
#      - fields_suggestions_id.yml
#      - ...
#    /relations
#      - relations_suggestions_tenant.yml
#      - ...
#    - base.yml

# USAGE
#
# ./explode_snapshot.sh <path_to_snapshot> <path_to_snapshots_folder>
#
# * path_to_snapshot: Path to the snapshot file that will be created by this script
# * path_to_snapshots_folder: Path to the folder where the individual snapshot fiels reside

# EXAMPLE
#
# ./implode_snapshot.sh ../snaphots/latest.yml ../snapshots

# NOTES
#
# * The <path_to_snapshots_folder> argument should not be followed by a `/`
