# DESCRIPTION
#
# This script will take a snapshot created by Directus and split it up into individual files, grouped by category (i.e. collections, fields, and relations). After running
# it, the target folder should have the following structure:
#
#  /target_folder
#    /collections
#      - collections_suggestions.yml
#      - ...
#    /fields
#      - fields_suggestions_id.yml
#      - ...
#    /relations
#      - relations_suggestions_tenant.yml
#      - ...
#    - base.yml

# USAGE
#
# ./explode_snapshot.sh <path_to_snapshot> <path_to_target_folder>
#
# * path_to_snapshot: Path to the snapshot file that you have created from running the `directus schema snapshot` command wherever you're running the CMS instance
# * path_to_target_folder: Path to the folder where the new snapshot structure will reside

# EXAMPLE
#
# ./explode_snapshot.sh ../snapshots/latest.yml ../snapshots

# NOTES
#
# * To create a snapshot in a Docker container, attach a shell to that container, run the command mentioned above, and copy it over to your local machine using the command
# `docker cp <src> <dest>`
# * The <path_to_target_folder> argument should not be followed by a `/`
